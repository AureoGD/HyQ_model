*Disclaimer*
------------
The HyQ model here does not follow the HyQ standards specification document, 
i.e. some of the joints (HAA only if I remember correctly) are rotated thus signs
will be different!

This code is based on the original implementation and instructions by Ioannis.
The matode / ode versions are quite old.
If you want to use the latest you might have to update some of the code.

Installation Instructions
------------
0. Unzip the two **ode0.12** and **matode**  zip files
1. Install **ode0.12** from the source, make sure you create the shared libs as **matode** will need these. 
2. Install **matode** (add to matlab path).
3. **hyq.m** and **hyq.xml** provide a quick use demo
